# PythonProjects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects. Each project is unique and demonstrates the versatility and capability of Python in different domains.

## Projects

1. **DataScienceHealthcare**: This project demonstrates the application of data science in the healthcare domain. It involves working with DICOM files, image processing, machine learning, natural language processing, and RDF data.
    - **Directory**: https://github.com/CS0NG0RM/PythonProjects/tree/main/DataScienceHealthcare
    - **Dependencies**: This project uses several Python packages including:
        - *Pydicom* for reading and manipulating DICOM files.
        - *SimpleITK* for image processing tasks.
        - *OS* module for operating system dependent functionality.
        - *NumPy* for working with large, multi-dimensional data.
        - *Matplotlib* for plotting data.
        - *rdflib* for working with RDF data.
    - **Usage**: Instructions on how to run the project, including how to create a list of all DICOM files within a specified folder, how to build and evaluate machine learning models, and how to perform basic natural language processing tasks.

2. **Exploring_Airbnb_Market_Trends**: This project involves analyzing Airbnb listing data. It demonstrates data importing from different file formats, data cleaning, data merging, and basic data analysis using pandas and numpy.
    - **Directory**: https://github.com/CS0NG0RM/PythonProjects/tree/main/Exploring_Airbnb_Market_Trends
    - **Dependencies**: This project uses several Python packages including:
        - *pandas* for data manipulation and analysis.
        - *numpy* for numerical computations.
    - **Usage**: Instructions on how to run the project, including how to import data from CSV, Excel, and TSV files, how to merge data frames, how to convert data types, and how to perform basic data analysis tasks such as finding the earliest and most recent review dates, counting the number of private room listings, and calculating the average listing price.
      
  3. **Drug Safety Analysis**: This project involves analyzing drug safety data. It demonstrates data importing, data cleaning, data grouping, hypothesis testing, data visualization, and statistical analysis using pandas, numpy, statsmodels, pingouin, seaborn, and matplotlib.
    - **Directory**: https://github.com/CS0NG0RM/PythonProjects/tree/main/Hypothesis_Testing_Healthcare_Drug%20Safety
    - **Dependencies**: This project uses several Python packages including:
        - *pandas* for data manipulation and analysis.
        - *numpy* for numerical computations.
        - *statsmodels* for statistical modeling.
        - *pingouin* for statistical analysis.
        - *seaborn* and *matplotlib* for data visualization.
    - **Usage**: Instructions on how to run the project, including how to import data from a CSV file, how to group and count data, how to perform a two-sided z-test, how to determine if two variables are independent, how to create a histogram, how to conduct a normality test, and how to conduct a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test.
